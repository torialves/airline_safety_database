This project is inspired by Forbes article about safest airlines to fly with in 2025 (https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurabegleybloom/2025/01/12/the-safest-airlines-in-the-world-ranked-in-a-new-report/). 
Since the data available on the article has an unreachable dataset for automation, all the information provided is based on the information found on websites like https://asn.flightsafety.org/d and https://www.airlineratings.com/ as they are trusted sources quoted by Forbes.

It is important to advice that all data present in the structure is not entirely accurate and is limited to information last updated in January/2025 and should be considered only for studying the technology often used in data analysis projects.
